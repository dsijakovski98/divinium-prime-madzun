            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>
              The story of our MADZUN begins in the distant 1896 when
              grandmother Maria decided to make madzun to use it as a sweetener
              for her delicious cakes and sweet bread. Over the years she
              perfected the recipe which became family inheritance. Nowadays the
              decision to register as a company and to place out madzun on the
              Macedonian market was based on our wish to present our traditional
              product to a wide audience. Through our madzun we not only offer
              you premium quality but also family tradition.

              <h2>The history of the MADZUN</h2>
              <p>
                Grape molasses also known as MADZUN, is a 100% natural
                concentrate of dehydrated grape must from white or red grapes
                varieties. The madzun and its medicinal and nutritional
                properties were known long ago. The Madzun as a drink, medicine
                and as a 100% substitute for sugar and other sweeteners have
                been known to our ancestors for over two thousand years and the
                story of the madzun is as old as the story about the wine.In
                recent History in Macedonia specificaly In the Tikvesh wine
                region the MADZUN has always been used as a substitute for sugar
                because it was in abundance and the sugar itself was too
                expensive at the time and people could not afford it and went
                for the cheaper variant of sweetening with madzun, unaware that
                using this divine food daily, had a beneficial effect on their
                health.

            <div class="main-p making-process-p">
              <h2>The making process</h2>
              <p>
                Тhe production of the madzun starts with the beginning of the
                grape harvest in the Tikvesh wine region. To make the most
                delicious madzun we select the best and the sweetest grape
                varieties. Harvesting is the first step in madzun making
                process. The grapes are harvested in plastic crates to avoid
                damage during transportation and to prevent fermentation. After
                the grapes are sorted, they are ready to be de-stemmed and
                crushed. For many years, men and women did this manually by
                stomping the grapes with their feet. Nowadays, we perform this
                mechanically.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mechanical grape crushers stomp or trod the grapes into what is
                called must. Must is simply freshly pressed grape juice that
                contains the skins, seeds, and solids. Pressing comes
                immediately after crushing. Using a grape press we separate the
                juice from the skins and seeds. The grape juice is then left
                overnight to sediment. After the sediment is sank to the bottom
                the clarified juice is ready for the next process. This process
                involves treatment of the juice with low and controlled heat
                which is under 80°C ,to ensure that all the nutrients stay
                intact, until almost all the water has evaporated and we are
                left with viscous and syrupy product with high natural sugar
                content.

              <h2>The benefits</h2>
              <p>
                For the madzun it is said to be as nutritious as mother's milk.
                It is rich in minerals (potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus,
                iron), vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, C, A, D), energy substances,
                tannins, flavonoids, antioxidants, grape sugar, organic acids.
                That's why, the madzun is a real treasure trove of nutrients
                that will help improve one's health.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
